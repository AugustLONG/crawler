docker-ssh
A container from Ubuntu 12.04 with openssh-server preinstalled to be used as a base image. Inspired by docker-wordpress-nginx container by Eugene Ware.

Installation

$ git clone https://github.com/sullof/docker-sshd.git
$ cd docker-sshd
Substitute the current authorized_keys file with your public key. If not, potentially, I could access your container : ) If you prefer to use a password, comment the keys block

Usage

Build the container:

$ sudo docker build -t sullof/sshd .
It's better if you change the tag using your Docker username.

To spawn a new instance and see the IP:

$ CONTAINER_ID=$(sudo docker run -d docker-ssh)
$ sudo docker inspect $CONTAINER_ID | grep IPAddress | awk '{ print $2 }' | tr -d ',"'
You will have a result like this:

172.17.0.74
And, finally, you should connect to the container with

$ ssh root@172.17.0.74
What after?

You can create new images starting your Dockerfile with something like

FROM sullof/sshd
and modify appropriately the supervisord.conf file without overwriting the previous one. For example, in your derivated images, you could use the following approach appending a new file:

$ ADD ./supervisord.conf.append /etc/supervisord.conf.append
$ RUN cat /etc/supervisord.conf.append >> /etc/supervisord.conf &&\
      rm /etc/supervisord.conf.append
There is an example at docker-wpngx.
